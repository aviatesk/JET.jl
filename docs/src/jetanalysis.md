# [Error Analysis](@id jetanalysis)

Julia's type system is quite expressive and its type inference is strong enough to generate highly
optimized code from its very concise and generic program.
But as opposed to other statically-compiled languages, Julia by design does NOT error nor warn anything
even if it detects possible errors during its compilation process no matter how serious they are.
Julia delays all the errors and warnings to the runtime.

This is actually a core design choice of the language
– on the one hand, Julia's dynamism allow it to work in places where data types are not fully decided
ahead of runtime just because Julia doesn't require it
– on the other hand, with Julia, it's not straightforward to have such modern development experiences
that a typical static language can offer, including static type checking and very rich IDE features.

JET is a trial to get the best of both worlds: can we have a sufficiently useful static analysis
without losing all the beauty of Julia's dynamism ?
JET directly employs Julia's builtin type inference system to enable a static analysis, so in that
sense its approach is very different from ["gradual typing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing),
which is a common technique to bring static analysis into a dynamic language, as used for
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for Python and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for JavaScript.
Rather, Julia's type inference system and JET are powered by the technique called ["abstract interpretation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation).
As like Julia can effectively optimize your simple and generic program, JET can also analyze
_just a normal_ Julia program and smartly detect possible errors, but statically. So in other word,
JET doesn't require any additional setups like scattering type annotations just for the sake of analysis.

## [Quick Start](@id jetanalysis-quick-start)

First you need to install and load JET.
JET is an ordinary Julia package, so you can install it via Julia's built-in package manager and use
it as like other packages.
```@repl quickstart
; # ] add JET # install JET via the built-in package manager

using JET
```

Let's start with a simplest example: how JET can find anything wrong with `sum("julia")` ?
[`@report_call`](@ref) and [`report_call`](@ref) analyzes a given function call and get back the
detected problems. They can be used in a similar way as [`@code_typed`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/InteractiveUtils/#InteractiveUtils.@code_typed)
and [`code_typed`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Base.code_typed), and those
[interactive entry points](@ref jetanalysis-interactive-entry) are the most easiest way to use JET:
```@repl quickstart
@report_call sum("julia")
```

So JET found two possible problems. Now let's see how they can occur in _actual execution_:
```@repl quickstart
sum("julia") # will lead to `MethodError: +(::Char, ::Char)`
sum("") # will lead to `MethodError: zero(Type{Char})`
```

We should note that `@report_call sum("julia")` could detect both of those two different errors that
can happen at runtime. This is because `@report_call` does a static analysis – it analyzes the
function call in a way that does NOT rely on runtime, and so it can reason about all the possible executions !
This is one of the biggest advantages of static analysis, because other alternatives to check
software qualities like "testing" usually rely on runtime and they can only represent a subset of
all the possible executions.

As mentioned above, JET is designed to work with _just a normal_ Julia program.
Let's define new arbitrary functions and run JET on it:
```@repl quickstart
function foo(s0)
    a = []
    for s in split(s0)
        push!(a, bar(s))
    end
    return sum(a)
end

bar(s::String) = parse(Int, s)

@report_call foo("1 2 3")
```

Now let's fix this problematic code.
Say, for some reason, we're not interested in errors that may happen in the context of `Base`
– we want to focus on fixing the error that happens from the definition of `bar`.
First, we can fix the definition of `bar` so that it can accept generic `AbstractString` input.
JET's analysis result can be dynamically updated when we refine a function definition, and so we
just need to add a new `bar(::AbstractString)` definition.
As for the second error, we can use the [`target_modules`](@ref result-config) configuration to limit
the analysis scope to the current module context to ignore the possible error that may happen within `sum(a)`[^1].

[^1]: We used `target_modules` just for the sake of demonstration. To make it idiomatic, we can
      initialize `a` as typed vector `a = Int[]`, and then we won't get any problem from `sum(a)`
      even without the `target_modules` configuration.

```@repl quickstart
# hot fix the definition of `bar`
bar(s::AbstractString) = parse(Int, s)

# now no errors should be reported !
@report_call target_modules=(@__MODULE__,) foo("1 2 3")
```

So far, we have used the default error analysis pass, which collects problems according to one
specific definition of "errors" (see the [`BasicPass`](@ref) for more details). JET offers other
error reporting passes, including the "sound" error detection ([`SoundPass`](@ref)) as well as the
"typo" detection pass ([`TypoPass`](@ref))[^2]. They can be switched using the `mode` configuration:

[^2]: Actually JET offers the framework to define your own abstract interpretation based analysis.
      See [`AbstractAnalyzer`-Framework](@ref) if interested.

```@repl quickstart
function myifelse(cond, a, b)
    if cond
        return a
    else
        return b
    end
end

# the default analysis pass doesn't report "non-boolean (T) used in boolean context" error
# as far as there is possibility when the condition "can" be bool (NOTE: Bool <: Integer)
report_call(myifelse, (Integer, Int, Int))

# the sound analyzer doens't permit such a case: it requires the type of a conditional value to be `Bool` strictly
report_call(myifelse, (Integer, Int, Int); mode=:sound)

function strange_sum(a)
    if rand(Bool)
        undefsum(a)
    else
        sum(a)
    end
end

# the default analysis pass will report both problems:
# - `undefsum` is not defined
# - `sum(a::Vector{Any})` can throw when `a` is empty
@report_call strange_sum([])

# the typo dection pass will only report the "typo"
@report_call mode=:typo strange_sum([])
```

We can use [`@test_call`](@ref) and [`test_call`](@ref) to assert that your program is free from
problems that `@report_call` can detect.
They work nicely with [`Test` standard library](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/)'s
unit-testing infrastructure:
```@repl quickstart
@test_call target_modules=(@__MODULE__,) foo("1 2 3")

using Test

# we can get the nice summery using `@testset` !
@testset "JET testset" begin
    @test_call target_modules=(@__MODULE__,) foo("1 2 3") # should pass

    test_call(myifelse, (Integer, Int, Int); mode=:sound)

    @test_call broken=true foo("1 2 3") # `broken` and `skip` options are supported

    @test foo("1 2 3") == 6 # of course other `Test` macros can be used in the same place
end
```

JET actually uses JET itself in its test pipeline.
JET's static analysis has been proven to be very useful and helped its development a lot.
If interested, take a peek at [JET's test suite](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl/blob/b9c284d8727b6f4d2b56e73dfa543e7aa9ce0176/test/runtests.jl#L59-L77).

Lastly, let's see the example that demonstrates JET can analyze "top-level" program.
The top-level analysis should be considered as a somewhat experimental feature, and at this moment
you may need additional configurations to run it correctly. Please read the descriptions of
[top-level entry points](@ref jetanalysis-toplevel-entry) and choose an appropriate entry point for
your use case. Here we run [`report_file`](@ref) on [demo.jl](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl/blob/master/demo.jl).
It automatically extracts and loads "definitions" of functions, structs and such,
and then analyzes their "usages" statically:
```@repl quickstart
report_file(normpath(Base.pkgdir(JET), "demo.jl"))
```


## [Entry Points](@id jetanalysis-entry)

### [Interactive Entry Points](@id jetanalysis-interactive-entry)

JET offers interactive analysis entry points that can be used similarly to
[`code_typed`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Base.code_typed) and its family:
```@docs
JET.@report_call
JET.report_call
```

### [`Test` Integration](@id jetanalysis-test-integration)

JET also exports entries that are fully integrated with [`Test` standard library](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/)'s unit-testing infrastructure.
It can be used in your test suite to assert your program is free from errors that JET can detect:
```@docs
JET.@test_call
JET.test_call
```

### [Top-level Entry Points](@id jetanalysis-toplevel-entry)

JET can also analyze your "top-level" program: it can just take your Julia script or package
and will report possible errors.

Note that JET will analyze your code "half-statically": JET will selectively interpret "definitions"
(like a function or struct definition) and try to simulate Julia's top-level code execution.
While it tries to avoid executing any other parts of code like function calls, but analyzes them
based on abstract interpretation instead (and this is a part where JET statically analyzes your code).
If you're interested in how JET selects "top-level definitions", please see [`JET.virtual_process`](@ref).

!!! warning
    Because JET will actually interpret "definitions" in your code, that part of top-level analysis
    certainly _runs_ your code. So we should note that JET can cause some side effects from your code;
    for example JET will try to expand all the macros used in your code, and so the side effects
    involved with macro expansions will also happen in JET's analysis process.
