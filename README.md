## behind the moar for performance ...

JET.jl employs Julia's type inference for bug reports.

!!! note
    JET.jl needs Julia versions 1.6 and higher;
    as such I recommend you give a try on this package with [using nightly version](https://julialang.org/downloads/nightlies/)
    or [building Julia from source](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). \
    Also note that JET deeply relies on the type inference routine implemented in [Julia's compiler](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/tree/master/base/compiler),
    and so JET analysis result can vary depending on your Julia version.
    In general, the newer your Julia version is, your can expect JET to analyze your code more accurately and quickly,
    because Julia's compiler is rapidly-advancing, literally day by day.


### demo

Say you have this strange and buggy file and want to know where to fix:

> demo.jl

```julia
# demo
# ====

# fibonacci
# ---------

fib(n) = n ≤ 2 ? n : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

fib(1000)   # never terminates in ordinal execution
fib(m)      # undef var
fib("1000") # obvious type error


# language features
# -----------------

# user-defined types
struct Ty{T}
    fld::T
end

function foo(a)
    v = Ty(a)
    return bar(v)
end

# macros will be expanded
@inline bar(n::T)     where {T<:Number} = n < 0 ? zero(T) : one(T)
@inline bar(v::Ty{T}) where {T<:Number} = bar(v.fdl) # typo "fdl"
@inline bar(v::Ty)                      = bar(convert(Number, v.fld))

foo(1.2)
foo("1") # `String` can't be converted to `Number`
```

You can have JET.jl detect possible errors:

```julia
julia> using JET

julia> profile_and_watch_file("demo.jl"; annotate_types = true)
[toplevel-info] analysis entered into demo.jl
[toplevel-info] analysis from demo.jl finished in 3.455 sec

┌ @ demo.jl:33 foo("1")
│┌ @ demo.jl:24 bar(v::Ty{String})
││┌ @ demo.jl:30 convert(Number, Base.getproperty(v::Ty{String}, :fld::Symbol)::String)
│││ no matching method found for call signature: convert(Number, Base.getproperty(v::Ty{String}, :fld::Symbol)::String)
││└──────────────
```

Hooray !
JET.jl found possible error points (e.g. `MethodError: no method matching isless(::String, ::Int64)`) given toplevel call signatures of generic functions (e.g. `fib("1000")`).

Note that JET can find these errors while demo.jl is so inefficient (especially the `fib` implementation) that it would never terminate in actual execution.
That is possible because JET analyzes code only on _type level_.
This technique is often called "abstract interpretation" and JET internally uses Julia's native type inference implementation, so it can analyze code as fast/correctly as Julia's code generation.

Lastly let's apply the following diff to demo.jl so that it works nicely:

> fix-demo.jl.diff

```diff
diff --git a/demo.jl b/demo-fixed.jl

If you apply the diff (i.e. update and save the demo.jl), JET will automatically re-trigger profiling, and this time, won't complain anything:

> `git apply fix-demo.jl.diff`

```julia

No errors !
```


### TODOs

- documentation: WIP at <https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl/pull/127>
- release: see <https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl/issues/121>
- more accurate error reports in general
  * enable constant propagation on union-split signatures (<https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/39305>)
- provide editor/IDE integrations for "watch" mode (<https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl/pull/85> will be a starting point)
- support package profiling (issue <https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl/issues/76>, something like PR <https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl/pull/101> can be a starting point)
- implement a "global" version of type inference algorithm (see [this comment](https://github.com/aviatesk/JET.jl/blob/80fd0d9586a01dda7e460ccd71d3d9f33189d4ba/src/abstractinterpretation.jl#L517-L523))
- performance linting (report performance pitfalls, i.e. report an error when there're too many methods matched)
- ideally, I want to extend JET.jl to provide some of LSPs other than diagnostics, e.g. providers of completions, rename refactor, etc.


### developer note

JET.jl overloads functions from Juila's `Core.Compiler` module, which are intended for its native JIT type inference.

They're overloaded on `JETInterpreter` so that `typeinf(::JETInterpreter, ::InferenceState)` will do abstract interpretation tuned for JET.jl's type error analysis.
Most overloads are done by using `invoke`, which allows us to call down to and reuse the original `NativeInterpreter`'s abstract interpretation methods while passing `JETInterpreter` for subsequent (maybe overloaded) callees (see `@invoke` macro).


### acknowledgement

This project started as my grad thesis project at Kyoto University, supervised by Prof. Takashi Sakuragawa.
We were heavily inspired by [ruby/typeprof](https://github.com/ruby/typeprof), an experimental type understanding/checking tool for Ruby.
The grad thesis about this project is published at <https://github.com/aviatesk/grad-thesis>, but currently it's only available in Japanese.
