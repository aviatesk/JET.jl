    JETBenchmarkUtils

This module exports utility macros to execute and benchmark arbitrary code in new Julia process:
- [`@freshexec ex`](@ref): executes `ex` in fresh process and restore its result back into the caller runtime
- [`@benchmark_freshexec ex`](@ref): returns statistics of execution of `ex` in a fresh process

!!! note
    `@benchmark_freshexec` is not integrated with [BenchmarkTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl)'s CI infrastructure.
    `JETBenchmarkTools` provides utilties for that.

import Base.Meta: isexpr

"""
    ret = @freshexec [setup_ex] ex

Runs `ex` in an external process and gets back the final result (, which is supposed to be
  such a simple Julia object that we can restore it from its string representation).
Running in external process can be useful for testing JET analysis, because:
- the first time analysis is not affected by native code cache and JET's global report cache
- we can do something that might break a Julia process without wondering it breaks the
  original test process later on
The optional positional argument `setup_ex` runs before each execution of `ex` and defaults
  to `JET_LOAD_EX`, which just loads JET into the process.

"""
    stats = @benchmark_freshexec [ntimes = 5] [setup_ex] ex

Runs `ex` in an external process multiple times (which can be configured by the optional
  keyword argument `ntimes`), and collects execution statistics from [`@timed`](@ref).
  The final result is the statistics from a trial with minimum execution time.
  The statistics are generated by taking the `mean` of all the trials.
Each "evaluation" of `ex` is done in new Julia process in order to benchmark the performance
  of the "first-time analysis", where the native code cache and JET's global report cache
  have no effect for execution (of course, this is very time-consuming though ...).
The optional positional argument `setup_ex` runs before each execution of `ex` and its
  execution statistis are not included in the benchmark result; it defaults to
  `JET_WARMUP_EX`, which loads JET and runs a warm up analysis `@report_call identity(nothing)`.
