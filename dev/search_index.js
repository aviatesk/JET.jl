And such type instabilities can lead to various optimization failures. One of the most common barriers to performance is known as \"runtime dispatch\", which happens when a matching method can't be resolved by the compiler due to the lack of type information and it is looked up at runtime instead. Since runtime dispatch is caused by poor type information, it often indicates the compiler could not do other optimizations including inlining and scalar replacements of aggregates.","category":"page"},{"location":"optanalysis/","page":"Optimization Analysis","title":"Optimization Analysis","text":"In order to avoid such problems, we usually inspect the output of code_typed or its family, and check if there is anywhere type is not well inferred and optimization was not successful.

Another problem is that they can only present the \"final\" output of the inference and optimization, and we can not inspect the entire call graph and may miss finding where a problem actually happened and how the type-instability has been propagated. There is a nice package called Cthulhu.jl, which allows us to look at the outputs of code_typed by descending into a call tree, recursively and interactively.

If this pass doesn't report any errors, then your program is assured to run without any runtime errors (unless JET's error definition is not accurate and/or there is an implementation flaw).\nSee SoundPass for more details.\nmode = :typo: a typo detection pass A simple analysis pass to detect \"typo\"s in your program. This analysis pass is essentially a subset of the default basic pass (BasicPass), and it only reports undefined global reference and undefined field access. This might be useful especially for a very complex code base, because even the basic pass tends to be too noisy (spammed with too many errors) for such a case.\nSee TypoPass for more details.\nnote: Note\nYou can also set up your own analysis using JET's AbstractAnalyzer-Framework.\n\n\n\nignore_missing_comparison::Bool = false:\nIf true, JET will ignores the possibility of a poorly-inferred comparison operator call (e.g. ==) returning missing in order to hide the error reports from branching on the potential missing return value of such a comparison operator call. This is turned off by default, because a comparison call results in a Union{Bool,Missing} possibility, it likely signifies an inferrability issue or the missing possibility should be handled someway. But this is useful to reduce the noisy error reports in the situations where specific input arguments type is not available at the beginning of the analysis like report_package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"jetanalysis/#JET.BasicPass","page":"Error Analysis","title":"JET.BasicPass","text":"The basic error analysis pass.

In the virtual code execution, JET will selectively interpret \"top-level definitions\" (like a function definition), while it tries to avoid executing any other parts of code including function calls that typically do a main computational task, leaving them to be analyzed by the succeeding abstract interpretation based analysis.\nHowever, currently, JET doesn't track \"inter-block\" level code dependencies, and therefore the selective interpretation of top-level definitions may fail when it needs to use global bindings defined in the other code blocks that have not been selected and actually interpreted (i.e. \"concretized\") but left for abstract interpretation (i.e. \"abstracted\").\nFor example, the issue would happen if the expansion of a macro uses a global variable, e.g.:\ntest/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl\n# JET doesn't conretize this by default, but just analyzes its type\nconst GLOBAL_CODE_STORE = Dict()\n\nmacro with_code_record(a)\n    GLOBAL_CODE_STORE[__source__] = a # record the code location in the global store\n    esc(a)\nend\n\n# here JET will try to actually expand `@with_code_record`,\n# but since `GLOBAL_CODE_STORE` didn't get concretized (i.e. instantiated), JET analysis will fail at this point\n@with_code_record foo(a) = identity(a)\n\nfoo(10) # top-level callsite, abstracted away\n\nTo circumvent this issue, JET offers this concretization_patterns::Vector{<:Any} configuration, which allows us to customize JET's top-level code concretization strategy. concretization_patterns specifies the patterns of code that should be concretized. To put in other word, when JET sees a code that matches any of code patterns specified by this configuration, JET will try to interpret and concretize the code, regardless of whether or not JET's default code selection logic decides to concretize it.\nJET uses MacroTools.jl's expression pattern match, and we can specify whatever code pattern expected by MacroTools.@capture macro. For example, in order to solve the issue explained above, we can have:\nconcretization_patterns = [:(const GLOBAL_CODE_STORE = Dict())]\nThen GLOBAL_CODE_STORE will just be concretized and so any top-level error won't happen at the macro expansion.\nSince configuring concretization_patterns properly can be tricky, JET offers a logging system that allows us to debug 's top-level code concretization plan. With the toplevel_logger configuration with specifying the logging level to be above than 1 (\"debug\") level, we can see:\nwhich code is matched with concretization_patterns and forcibly concretized\nwhich code is selected to be concretized by JET's default code selection logic: where t-annotated statements are concretized while f-annotated statements are abstracted\njulia> report_file(\"test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl\";\n                   concretization_patterns = [:(const GLOBAL_CODE_STORE = Dict())],\n                   toplevel_logger = IOContext(stdout, :JET_LOGGER_LEVEL => 1))\n[toplevel-debug] virtualized the context of Main (took 0.003 sec)\n[toplevel-debug] entered into test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl\n[toplevel-debug] concretization pattern `const GLOBAL_CODE_STORE = Dict()` matched `const GLOBAL_CODE_STORE = Dict()` at test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl:2\n[toplevel-debug] concretization plan at test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl:4:\n1 f 1 ─      $(Expr(:thunk, CodeInfo(\n    @ none within `top-level scope`\n1 ─     return $(Expr(:method, Symbol(\"@with_code_record\")))\n)))\n2 t │        $(Expr(:method, Symbol(\"@with_code_record\")))\n3 t │   %3 = Core.Typeof(var\"@with_code_record\")\n4 t │   %4 = Core.svec(%3, Core.LineNumberNode, Core.Module, Core.Any)\n5 t │   %5 = Core.svec()\n6 t │   %6 = Core.svec(%4, %5, $(QuoteNode(:(#= test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl:4 =#))))\n7 t │        $(Expr(:method, Symbol(\"@with_code_record\"), :(%6), CodeInfo(\n    @ test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl:5 within `none`\n1 ─      $(Expr(:meta, :nospecialize, :(a)))\n│        Base.setindex!(GLOBAL_CODE_STORE, a, __source__)\n│   @ test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl:6 within `none`\n│   %3 = esc(a)\n└──      return %3\n)))\n8 f └──      return var\"@with_code_record\"\n[toplevel-debug] concretization plan at test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl:11:\n1 f 1 ─      $(Expr(:thunk, CodeInfo(\n    @ none within `top-level scope`\n1 ─     return $(Expr(:method, :foo))\n)))\n2 t │        $(Expr(:method, :foo))\n3 t │   %3 = Core.Typeof(foo)\n4 t │   %4 = Core.svec(%3, Core.Any)\n5 t │   %5 = Core.svec()\n6 t │   %6 = Core.svec(%4, %5, $(QuoteNode(:(#= test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl:11 =#))))\n7 t │        $(Expr(:method, :foo, :(%6), CodeInfo(\n    @ test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl:11 within `none`\n1 ─ %1 = identity(a)\n└──      return %1\n)))\n8 f └──      return foo\n[toplevel-debug] concretization plan at test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl:13:\n1 f 1 ─ %1 = foo(10)\n2 f └──      return %1\n[toplevel-debug]  exited from test/fixtures/concretization_patterns.jl (took 0.032 sec)\nAlso see: the toplevel_logger section below, virtual_process.\nnote: Note\nreport_package automatically sets this configuration asconcretization_patterns = [:(x_)]meaning that it will concretize all top-level code included in a package being analyzed.\n\n\n\ntoplevel_logger::Union{Nothing,IO} = nothing \nIf IO object is given, it will track JET's toplevel analysis.
