# JET.jl plug-in analysis examples

This directory keeps examples that demonstrates JET's extensibility;
we can do various kinds of analysis undef under JET's pluggable-analysis framework.

The examples are written in the [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) format,
and will automatically be included into JET's documentation.
